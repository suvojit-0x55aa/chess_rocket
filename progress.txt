## Codebase Patterns
- Python 3.10+ required
- python-chess library for chess logic (Board, Move, etc.)
- Stockfish minimum UCI_Elo is 1320 - use depth limiting + random moves below that
- MCP server uses FastMCP from mcp.server.fastmcp
- TUI syncs via data/current_game.json file polling at 4Hz
- SRS uses SM-2 algorithm
- All user data stored in data/ directory
- Progress state in data/progress.json
