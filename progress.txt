## Codebase Patterns
- Python 3.10+ required
- python-chess library for chess logic (Board, Move, etc.)
- Stockfish minimum UCI_Elo is 1320 - use depth limiting + random moves below that
- MCP server uses FastMCP from mcp.server.fastmcp
- TUI syncs via data/current_game.json file polling at 4Hz
- SRS uses SM-2 algorithm
- All user data stored in data/ directory
- Progress state in data/progress.json

## 2026-02-06 - US-008: Create Curriculum and Pedagogy Reference Files
- Created references/curriculum.md: 3-phase curriculum (Foundation 0-600, Tactical Basics 600-1000, Intermediate 1000-1500)
  - Each phase includes 6-7 detailed lessons with learning objectives and prerequisites
  - Lessons cover foundational concepts through advanced strategic planning
  - Cross-references with pedagogy and learning science documentation
  
- Created references/chess-pedagogy.md: GM coaching methodology
  - 7 major sections: Socratic Method, Pattern Recognition, Deliberate Practice, Error Analysis, Progressive Complexity, Teaching by Elo, Growth Mindset
  - Practical examples for each teaching technique
  - Language adaptation guidelines for different Elo ranges
  - Integration with Speedrun system architecture
  
- Created references/learning-science.md: Cognitive science foundations
  - 9 major sections grounded in research (Ericsson, Vygotsky, Ebbinghaus, Sweller, Dweck, etc.)
  - Explains why each pedagogy technique is effective
  - Practical application to chess learning
  - Integration section showing how principles work together
  
- Created references/elo-milestones.md: Skills and expectations by Elo range
  - 3 detailed Elo ranges with concrete skills, common mistakes, readiness indicators
  - Cross-level pattern tables showing progression
  - Teaching guidance for assessing level and setting goals
  - Links to pedagogy and curriculum for appropriate interventions

**Files changed:**
- Created: /references/curriculum.md (396 lines)
- Created: /references/chess-pedagogy.md (456 lines)
- Created: /references/learning-science.md (470 lines)
- Created: /references/elo-milestones.md (462 lines)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Curriculum structure uses 3 phases aligned to Elo ranges (0-600, 600-1000, 1000-1500)
- Each phase needs 6-7 lessons for comprehensive coverage without overwhelming learners
- Pedagogy references specific teaching techniques: Socratic method, pattern recognition, deliberate practice
- Learning science grounding is critical for tutor justifying recommendations
- Cross-references between files create interconnected knowledge base (used by SKILL.md in US-011)
- Elo milestones provide clear expectations for what players at each level should achieve
- Teaching language must adapt based on Elo: concrete (0-600), principle-based (600-1000), strategic (1000-1500)
