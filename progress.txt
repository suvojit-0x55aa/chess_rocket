## Codebase Patterns
- Python 3.10+ required
- python-chess library for chess logic (Board, Move, etc.)
- Stockfish minimum UCI_Elo is 1320 - use depth limiting + random moves below that
- MCP server uses FastMCP from mcp.server.fastmcp
- TUI syncs via data/current_game.json file polling at 4Hz
- SRS uses SM-2 algorithm
- All user data stored in data/ directory
- Progress state in data/progress.json
- Use `uv run python` to execute scripts (system python3 lacks project deps)

## 2026-02-06 - US-008: Create Curriculum and Pedagogy Reference Files
- Created references/curriculum.md: 3-phase curriculum (Foundation 0-600, Tactical Basics 600-1000, Intermediate 1000-1500)
  - Each phase includes 6-7 detailed lessons with learning objectives and prerequisites
  - Lessons cover foundational concepts through advanced strategic planning
  - Cross-references with pedagogy and learning science documentation
  
- Created references/chess-pedagogy.md: GM coaching methodology
  - 7 major sections: Socratic Method, Pattern Recognition, Deliberate Practice, Error Analysis, Progressive Complexity, Teaching by Elo, Growth Mindset
  - Practical examples for each teaching technique
  - Language adaptation guidelines for different Elo ranges
  - Integration with Speedrun system architecture
  
- Created references/learning-science.md: Cognitive science foundations
  - 9 major sections grounded in research (Ericsson, Vygotsky, Ebbinghaus, Sweller, Dweck, etc.)
  - Explains why each pedagogy technique is effective
  - Practical application to chess learning
  - Integration section showing how principles work together
  
- Created references/elo-milestones.md: Skills and expectations by Elo range
  - 3 detailed Elo ranges with concrete skills, common mistakes, readiness indicators
  - Cross-level pattern tables showing progression
  - Teaching guidance for assessing level and setting goals
  - Links to pedagogy and curriculum for appropriate interventions

**Files changed:**
- Created: /references/curriculum.md (396 lines)
- Created: /references/chess-pedagogy.md (456 lines)
- Created: /references/learning-science.md (470 lines)
- Created: /references/elo-milestones.md (462 lines)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Curriculum structure uses 3 phases aligned to Elo ranges (0-600, 600-1000, 1000-1500)
- Each phase needs 6-7 lessons for comprehensive coverage without overwhelming learners
- Pedagogy references specific teaching techniques: Socratic method, pattern recognition, deliberate practice
- Learning science grounding is critical for tutor justifying recommendations
- Cross-references between files create interconnected knowledge base (used by SKILL.md in US-011)
- Elo milestones provide clear expectations for what players at each level should achieve
- Teaching language must adapt based on Elo: concrete (0-600), principle-based (600-1000), strategic (1000-1500)

## 2026-02-06 - US-009: Create Tactical Patterns and Mistakes Reference Files
- Files already existed (created alongside US-008) but were untracked - committed them
- references/tactical-patterns.md: 7 tactical patterns (forks x3, pins x2, skewers, discovered attacks, discovered check, double check, back-rank threats)
- references/common-mistakes.md: 9 common mistakes with severity classification (hanging pieces, ignoring threats, premature queen, not castling, same piece twice, no center control, trading when behind, neglecting development, not looking for checks)
- references/opening-guide.md: 4 beginner-friendly openings (Italian Game, London System, Sicilian Defense, Scandinavian Defense)

**Files changed:**
- Committed: references/tactical-patterns.md
- Committed: references/common-mistakes.md
- Committed: references/opening-guide.md

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- US-008 iteration created US-009 files too - always check git status for untracked files from previous iterations
- Reference files cross-reference each other (tactical-patterns.md referenced from opening-guide.md)
- All reference files are now in place for SKILL.md (US-011) to reference

## 2026-02-06 - US-010: Create Curated Puzzle Sets with FEN Validation
- All 6 puzzle JSON files already existed from a previous iteration (untracked)
- Validated all 69 puzzles across 6 files using scripts/validate_puzzles.py
- All FENs load in python-chess, all solution_moves are legal in sequence
- Committed all puzzle files and validator script

**Files changed:**
- Committed: puzzles/forks.json (12 puzzles)
- Committed: puzzles/pins.json (12 puzzles)
- Committed: puzzles/skewers.json (11 puzzles)
- Committed: puzzles/back-rank.json (12 puzzles)
- Committed: puzzles/checkmate-patterns.json (11 puzzles)
- Committed: puzzles/beginner-endgames.json (11 puzzles)
- Committed: scripts/validate_puzzles.py

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Puzzle files and validator were created in earlier iterations but left untracked - always check git status
- Use `uv run python` to execute scripts (system python3 lacks chess module)
- validate_puzzles.py checks: FEN validity, UCI move parsing, sequential move legality
- Each puzzle requires: fen, solution_moves (UCI), solution_san, motif, difficulty, explanation

## 2026-02-06 - US-013: Create Claude Settings and Run Integration Verification
- Verified .claude/settings.json exists with correct MCP server config (command: python, args: [mcp-server/server.py])
- Ran py_compile on all 8 Python files (7 in scripts/, 1 in mcp-server/) - all pass
- Ran validate_puzzles.py - all 69 puzzles across 6 files valid
- Verified all 8 required directories exist: data/sessions, data/games, data/lesson_plans, references/, puzzles/, mcp-server/, scripts/, .claude/
- Verified all 10 required files exist: install.sh, engine.py, srs.py, tui.py, export.py, models.py, validate_puzzles.py, server.py, SKILL.md, settings.json
- Committed remaining untracked project files: scripts/__init__.py, scripts/models.py, scripts/install.sh, documentation/, uv.lock

**Files changed:**
- Verified: .claude/settings.json (already had correct MCP config)
- Updated: prd.json (US-013 passes: true)
- Committed untracked: scripts/__init__.py, scripts/models.py, scripts/install.sh, documentation/, uv.lock

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- .claude/settings.json was created by earlier iterations - always check if it exists before creating
- Integration verification is about running ALL checks, not writing new code
- Some files created in US-001 (models.py, __init__.py, install.sh) may remain untracked through many iterations - final story catches these
- chess-openings/ directory is external data, not part of the project structure
