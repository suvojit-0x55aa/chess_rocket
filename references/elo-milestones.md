This document outlines the specific skills, common mistakes, and readiness indicators for each Elo range. It serves as a reference for understanding what a player at a given level can typically do, what they struggle with, and what they need to work on next.

---

## Range 1: Beginner (0-600 Elo)

### What These Players Can Do

Players at this level have foundational chess knowledge but lack pattern recognition. They understand rules and basic tactics but haven't automated pattern recognition yet.

#### Concrete Skills
- **Move all pieces correctly** - Can move any piece according to its rules
- **Recognize basic check/checkmate** - Can identify when king is under attack; understand the concept of checkmate
- **Find one-move wins** - Can spot basic hanging pieces and obvious captures
- **Execute basic checkmates** - Can perform K+Q vs K or K+R vs K with prompting
- **Make legal moves consistently** - Doesn't need to be coached on move legality
- **Read algebraic notation** - Can understand move descriptions like "e4" or "Nf3"

#### Strategic Thinking (Minimal)
- Understands piece values in principle
- Can sometimes avoid trading worse pieces for better ones
- Tries to control the center with limited success
- Attempts to develop pieces but without consistent logic

#### Tactical Vision (Limited)
- Sees obvious, one-move tactics
- Misses most multi-move combinations
- Doesn't systematically look for opponent threats
- Frequently hangs pieces without noticing

### Common Mistakes at This Level

#### Mistake 1: Hanging Pieces (Leaving Pieces Undefended)
**Why it happens:** Limited scanning of the board; doesn't check opponent's possible captures before moving.

**Characteristics:**
- Leaves pieces where opponent can capture them for free
- Makes illegal-seeming moves like moving the queen where it can be captured
- Doesn't seem bothered by losing pieces until it's explained

**Teaching response:**
1. Point out the hanging piece immediately
2. Ask: "Can your opponent capture this?"
3. Ask: "What would you lose if they did?"
4. Teach the habit: Check for opponent captures after considering any move
5. Create SRS card for this specific position

#### Mistake 2: Ignoring Opponent Threats
**Why it happens:** Tunnel vision on own moves; doesn't systematically consider opponent's options.

**Characteristics:**
- Makes a move that appears to accomplish their goal, not noticing opponent has a stronger response
- Walks king into obvious danger
- Doesn't ask "What can my opponent do now?"

**Teaching response:**
1. Show the opponent's strongest response
2. Ask: "Did you consider this?"
3. Teach: "After every move you consider, ask: What's my opponent's best response?"
4. Practice with questions like "What's White's best move?" → "What's Black's response?"

#### Mistake 3: Poor Piece Placement
**Why it happens:** No sense of which squares are strong for pieces; moves pieces randomly.

**Characteristics:**
- Places knights on the edge of the board (bad squares)
- Moves bishops to less active positions
- Creates passive, cramped positions

**Teaching response:**
1. Compare piece placements: "Your knight on h3 controls 2 squares. If it were on e4, it would control 8 squares."
2. Teach: "Each piece has strong squares and weak squares."
3. Practice: "Where's the best square for this knight?"

#### Mistake 4: Lack of Opening Knowledge
**Why it happens:** Hasn't learned any opening principles or systems.

**Characteristics:**
- Moves seemingly random opening moves
- Develops pieces inefficiently
- Leaves king in center too long
- Overlooks normal opening moves

**Teaching response:**
1. Teach opening principles (center control, development, king safety)
2. Show a sample opening position following principles
3. Practice: "In this opening position, where should the queen go?"

#### Mistake 5: Not Recognizing Checkmate
**Why it happens:** Limited pattern recognition of checkmate patterns.

**Characteristics:**
- Doesn't notice when opponent has checkmate
- Misses opportunities to checkmate opponent
- Plays on in lost positions

**Teaching response:**
1. Show the checkmate pattern clearly
2. Ask: "Can the king move? Is it in check? Can anything block or capture?"
3. Teach checkmating patterns one at a time
4. Practice: Solve checkmate puzzles to build pattern recognition

### Readiness to Advance to 600+ Elo

A player is ready to advance when they demonstrate:

- Solves 100+ one-move tactics with 80%+ accuracy
- Plays 10+ games without hanging pieces more than once
- Correctly identifies checkmate in most positions
- Demonstrates basic opening principles in games
- Can correctly explain piece values
- Shows improvement week-to-week in puzzle solving
- Expresses comfort with rules and basic concepts

**Red flags (not ready yet):**
- Frequently hangs pieces during games
- Doesn't seem to notice when pieces are hanging
- Doesn't understand why trades are good or bad
- Makes very poor opening moves (like opening with h4)

---

## Range 2: Developing Player (600-1000 Elo)

### What These Players Can Do

Players at this level have developed pattern recognition for basic tactics. They understand principles and can apply them with some consistency. They're beginning to think strategically.

#### Concrete Skills
- **Recognize all major tactical patterns** - Sees forks, pins, skewers, discovered attacks
- **Calculate 2-3 moves ahead** - Can think beyond immediate moves
- **Play logical openings** - Follows opening principles consistently
- **Execute fundamental endgames** - Can convert simple material advantages
- **Play by time controls** - Can play at increasing time controls without blundering excessively
- **Analyze positions verbally** - Can explain why a position is better or worse

#### Strategic Thinking (Developing)
- Understands weak squares and creates them
- Considers pawn structure implications
- Recognizes passed pawns and understands their strength
- Attempts to coordinate pieces with purpose
- Plans several moves ahead in clear positions

#### Tactical Vision (Strong)
- Sees two-move tactical combinations
- Misses most three-move combinations
- Sees opponent's main threats
- Recognizes most tactical patterns
- Occasionally hangs pieces but less frequently

### Common Mistakes at This Level

#### Mistake 1: Missing Opponent's Counterattacks
**Why it happens:** Tunnel vision on attacking; doesn't defend adequately.

**Characteristics:**
- Creates strong attack but leaves back rank or kingside weak
- Opponent's counterattack is stronger than the attack
- Loses quickly when attack is blocked

**Teaching response:**
1. After the tactical blow: "What was Black's counterattack?"
2. Ask: "Could you have prevented it?"
3. Teach: "Strong offense requires adequate defense"
4. Practice: "Find the strongest defense before starting your attack"

#### Mistake 2: Poor Endgame Technique
**Why it happens:** Endgames require concrete calculation rather than general principles; player hasn't studied endgames.

**Characteristics:**
- Wins material but can't convert to checkmate
- Loses drawn positions due to poor technique
- Doesn't know basic King and Pawn vs King endgame techniques
- Pushes passed pawns at wrong times

**Teaching response:**
1. Study fundamental endgames (K+P vs K, R vs R+P, Q vs Q+P)
2. Practice: "With correct play, this endgame should be drawn. Can you hold it?"
3. Create endgame SRS cards for recurring positions

#### Mistake 3: Inefficient Piece Activity
**Why it happens:** Doesn't understand which squares are best for pieces in the position.

**Characteristics:**
- Plays moves like Ra1-a2-a3 instead of finding active rook placement
- Bishops on long diagonals blocked by pawns
- Knights on edges instead of centralized
- Passive piece positioning

**Teaching response:**
1. Show where the piece should go
2. Ask: "Why is e4 better than h5 for this knight?"
3. Teach: "Place pieces where they control important squares"
4. Practice: "Find the most active square for each piece"

#### Mistake 4: Weak Opening Preparation
**Why it happens:** Hasn't studied opening systems; plays by intuition.

**Characteristics:**
- Quickly gets out of opening knowledge
- Positions become unclear due to unusual opening moves
- Often ends up in slightly worse positions
- Uses too much time thinking in the opening

**Teaching response:**
1. Choose 1-2 opening systems to study
2. Practice: Play that system repeatedly until it's automatic
3. Study: Look at master games in that system
4. Prepare: Learn the key ideas and typical plans

#### Mistake 5: Not Recognizing Draw Situations
**Why it happens:** Doesn't understand when positions are drawn or understands stalemate but not fortress positions.

**Characteristics:**
- Plays on in clearly drawn positions
- Offers draws too early when winning
- Accepts draws when winning
- Doesn't recognize perpetual check possibilities

**Teaching response:**
1. Study draw patterns (perpetual check, stalemate, fortress)
2. Ask: "Can either side make progress in this position?"
3. Teach: "Know when you're in danger of a draw and how to play for a win"

### Readiness to Advance to 1000+ Elo

A player is ready to advance when they demonstrate:

- Solves 100+ tactical puzzles (2-3 moves) with 70%+ accuracy
- Plays 10+ games where opening play follows logical principles
- Demonstrates tactical awareness (notices threats, defends adequately)
- Can analyze positions with multiple candidate moves
- Converts simple advantages into wins most games
- Shows understanding of pawn structure and weak squares
- Expresses frustration when tactical patterns miss (sign of pattern recognition developing)

**Red flags (not ready yet):**
- Still hangs pieces at high frequency
- Doesn't see opponent's main threats
- Loses won positions through poor endgame play
- Can't explain why positions are better or worse

## Range 3: Intermediate Player (1000-1500 Elo)

### What These Players Can Do

Players at this level have strong tactical vision and understand strategic principles. They can plan multiple moves ahead and execute complex positions with good technique.

#### Concrete Skills
- **Recognize and execute complex tactics** - Sees 3-4 move tactical combinations
- **Calculate 4-5 moves ahead** - In typical positions, calculates multiple candidate moves deeply
- **Play multiple opening systems well** - Has repertoire and understands key ideas
- **Analyze positions accurately** - Can correctly evaluate who's better and why
- **Execute complex endgames** - Can handle 3-4 piece endgames with technique
- **Manage time effectively** - Makes decisions quickly when they should, takes time for critical positions

#### Strategic Thinking (Strong)
- Understands weak squares and creates comprehensive plans around them
- Evaluates pawn structures accurately
- Recognizes when activity compensates for material
- Creates long-term plans (3-5 moves ahead minimum)
- Coordinates pieces with purpose and threatens multiple objectives
- Understands positional sacrifices and compensation

#### Tactical Vision (Excellent)
- Sees three-move combinations reliably
- Misses complex 4+ move sacrificial combinations
- Sees opponent's threats in most positions
- Occasionally catches even opponent's subtle ideas
- Rarely hangs pieces; when they do, it's usually a calculated sacrifice

### Common Mistakes at This Level

#### Mistake 1: Positional Inaccuracy
**Why it happens:** Focuses too much on tactics; misses subtle positional advantages.

**Characteristics:**
- Plays a strong tactical move but creates a long-term weakness
- Wins material but the resulting position is worse positionally
- Makes trades that simplify the position to the opponent's advantage
- Doesn't recognize when quiet moves are stronger than forcing moves

**Teaching response:**
1. Analyze the move: "The move wins material, but what about the position?"
2. Ask: "How will the position develop after this move?"
3. Teach: "Sometimes a quiet move is stronger than a forcing move"
4. Study: Master games where quiet moves or sacrifices achieve positional goals

#### Mistake 2: Calculation Errors in Complex Positions
**Why it happens:** Calculates too quickly or misses key possibilities.

**Characteristics:**
- Calculates a line and thinks it wins, but misses opponent's defensive resource
- Miscalculates the final position (thinks they're winning when it's drawn)
- In time pressure, plays too quickly
- Doesn't verify calculations before playing

**Teaching response:**
1. Show the missed variation
2. Ask: "Did you consider this response?"
3. Teach: "Verify your calculations. Look for opponent's defensive resources."
4. Practice: Position analysis where you force yourself to find 3+ candidate responses

#### Mistake 3: Weak Opening Play Under Pressure
**Why it happens:** Opponent plays unexpected opening moves; doesn't handle unfamiliar positions.

**Characteristics:**
- Plays known openings well but struggles when opponent varies
- Makes positional concessions trying to get back on track
- Uses too much time dealing with unfamiliar positions
- Gets gradually worse positions over the opening

**Teaching response:**
1. Study: Learn the underlying principles of your openings
2. Practice: Play against unusual moves in your openings
3. Understand: "What's the idea behind my opening system?"
4. Flexibility: Develop flexibility in your opening while maintaining principles

#### Mistake 4: Overestimating Compensation
**Why it happens:** Believes activity is worth more than it is; plays for complications.

**Characteristics:**
- Makes sacrifices that look good but don't have sufficient compensation
- Believes active pieces will create winning chances
- Doesn't calculate whether compensation will materialize
- Plays on in positions where material advantage is simply winning

**Teaching response:**
1. Analyze the sacrifice: "Do you have sufficient compensation?"
2. Ask: "What's your concrete threat after the sacrifice?"
3. Teach: "Activity must have purpose. Count material and concrete threats."
4. Study: Games where sacrifices have clear objectives vs. where they don't work

#### Mistake 5: Not Adapting to Position Requirements
**Why it happens:** Plays the same style regardless of the position (always attacks or always plays solid).

**Characteristics:**
- Attacks when defense is needed
- Defends passively when the position requires aggression
- Doesn't adjust strategy based on opponent's play
- Plays own plan without considering what position requires

**Teaching response:**
1. Ask: "What does this position require?"
2. Teach: "Different positions require different approaches"
3. Study: Master games where the player adapts their approach to the position
4. Practice: Same type of positions where you practice different approaches

### Readiness to Advance Beyond 1500 Elo

A player ready for master-level play demonstrates:

- Solves 150+ complex puzzles (4+ moves) with 65%+ accuracy
- Plays master-level games with few serious errors
- Understands opening theory at intermediate depth
- Accurately evaluates complex positions with multiple imbalances
- Successfully executes complex strategic plans
- Converts positional advantages reliably
- Shows interest in studying specific openings, endgames, and complex positions
- Can articulate why moves are better or worse in complex situations

**Red flags (not ready for next level):**
- Still makes significant positional errors
- Struggles with calculation in complex positions
- Limited opening knowledge or understanding
- Can't convert advantages against resistance
- Plays one-dimensional chess (always attacks, always defends)

## Using Elo Milestones for Teaching

### Assessing Current Level

1. **Give a 20-puzzle test:** Mix of one-, two-, and three-move puzzles
2. **Observe accuracy:**
   - 80%+ one-move puzzles: Beginner solid
   - 70%+ two-move puzzles: Developing player solid
   - 60%+ three-move puzzles: Intermediate solid
3. **Play 3-5 games** and observe:
   - How often do they hang pieces?
   - What strategies do they employ?
   - How do they handle unfamiliar positions?
   - How deep is their calculation?

### Setting Appropriate Goals

For each Elo range, set specific goals:

**Beginner (0-600):**
- "This week, focus on not hanging pieces"
- "Learn these 5 opening principles"
- "Solve 50 one-move tactics this week"

**Developing (600-1000):**
- "Improve your two-move tactical seeing from 65% to 75%"
- "Play 5 games with the Italian Game opening"
- "Study these 3 fundamental endgames"

**Intermediate (1000-1500):**
- "Solve 50 three-move combinations this week"
- "Build your opening repertoire: add one new system"
- "Study Rook and Knight vs King endgame technique"

### Adjusting Difficulty

- Player solving >80% of puzzles? Increase difficulty
- Player solving <50% of puzzles? Decrease difficulty
- Player frustrated? Look for motivational issues, check if difficulty is too high
