# Chess Speedrun Curriculum

A three-phase progressive curriculum designed to take learners from complete beginner (0 Elo) to intermediate player (1500 Elo). Each phase builds on the previous one, with clear learning objectives and measurable milestones.

## Curriculum Philosophy

This curriculum is grounded in **deliberate practice** and **progressive complexity** principles. Rather than overwhelming learners with all chess knowledge at once, we carefully sequence concepts so that each new idea connects to previously learned material. The curriculum uses a spiral learning approach—we return to earlier concepts with increasing depth and sophistication at each level.

## Phase 1: Foundation (0-600 Elo)

**Duration:** 20-40 hours of study and practice
**Target Audience:** Complete beginners with little to no chess experience
**Learning Method:** Visual pattern recognition and guided practice

### Prerequisites

- No prior chess experience required
- Ability to read and follow English instructions
- Access to a chess board (physical or digital)

### Learning Objectives

By the end of Phase 1, learners will:
- Understand the chess board layout and piece positions
- Move all pieces correctly according to standard rules
- Recognize check, checkmate, and stalemate positions
- Evaluate material balance using piece values
- Execute basic one-move tactical patterns
- Understand the fundamental checkmate patterns
- Apply basic opening principles

### Phase 1 Lessons

#### Lesson 1.1: Board Setup and Piece Movement
**Duration:** 2-3 hours

Learn the initial board setup and how each piece moves. This lesson focuses on memorizing piece movements through repetition and pattern recognition.

- Board orientation and square naming (algebraic notation)
- Pawn movement (forward one square, two squares from starting position, captures diagonally)
- Rook movement (straight lines horizontally and vertically)
- Bishop movement (diagonal lines, one bishop on light squares, one on dark)
- Knight movement (L-shaped: 2+1 or 1+2 squares, unique jumping ability)
- Queen movement (combines rook and bishop movements)
- King movement (one square in any direction, most important piece)
- Special moves: castling (king safety + rook activation), en passant (pawn captures)

**Key insight:** Each piece's movement pattern reflects its historical role in medieval warfare.

#### Lesson 1.2: Check, Checkmate, and Stalemate
**Duration:** 2-3 hours

Understand the three most important board positions and how games end.

- Check: when the king is under direct attack
- The three ways to respond to check: move the king, block the attack, capture the attacking piece
- Checkmate: check with no legal response (loss condition)
- Stalemate: not in check but no legal moves available (draw)
- Other draw conditions: insufficient material, threefold repetition, fifty-move rule

**Key insight:** Learning to recognize checkmate patterns is essential for both attacking and defending effectively.

#### Lesson 1.3: Piece Values and Material Exchange
**Duration:** 1-2 hours

Understand the relative strength of each piece to evaluate whether trades are favorable.

- Standard piece values: Pawn=1, Knight=3, Bishop=3, Rook=5, Queen=9, King=infinite
- Material advantage and disadvantage
- Fair exchanges: trading equal material
- Favorable exchanges: trading fewer/weaker pieces for more/stronger pieces
- When to trade pieces (up material, heading toward endgame)
- When to avoid trades (down material, need active pieces)

**Key insight:** Understanding piece values allows you to make quick decisions about whether to trade pieces.

#### Lesson 1.4: Simple One-Move Tactics
**Duration:** 3-4 hours

Learn to spot and execute simple tactical patterns in one move. This builds pattern recognition.

- Hanging pieces (undefended pieces that can be captured for free)
- Simple captures: choosing which captures are best
- Basic forks: attacking two pieces simultaneously
- Removing a defender: capturing a piece that defends another piece
- Recognition training: solving 30+ one-move puzzle positions

**Key insight:** Spending time on one-move tactics builds the visual pattern recognition that's essential for chess.

#### Lesson 1.5: Basic Checkmate Patterns
**Duration:** 2-3 hours

Learn the fundamental checkmate patterns that appear in many games.

- Back-rank mate: trapping the king on its back rank
- Queen and king vs lone king checkmate: basic technique for converting material advantage
- Rook and king vs lone king checkmate: essential endgame knowledge
- Scholar's mate and fool's mate: learning what to avoid
- Two rooks checkmate: one rook controls the rank, one the file

**Key insight:** These patterns appear repeatedly in games. Mastering them builds confidence and prevents checkmate blindness.

#### Lesson 1.6: Opening Principles
**Duration:** 2-3 hours

Learn the fundamental rules for sound opening play that apply across all chess positions.

- Control the center: placing pawns and pieces in the middle of the board
- Develop pieces before moving the same piece twice: get knights and bishops out
- King safety: castle early (usually within the first 10-15 moves)
- Avoid moving the queen out too early: the queen becomes a target for development moves
- Connect rooks: develop both sides so rooks support each other
- Avoid weakening the kingside: keep escape squares for the king

**Key insight:** These principles apply to every opening. Masters violate them sometimes, but you must master them first.

### Phase 1 Success Criteria

- Solve 50+ one-move tactical puzzles with 80%+ accuracy
- Play 5+ full games without illegal moves
- Correctly identify checkmate positions in 30 different scenarios
- Demonstrate basic opening principles in game play
- Understand piece values and make logical trade decisions

### Phase 1 Common Mistakes to Address

See `references/common-mistakes.md` for detailed teaching responses to:
- Hanging pieces (leaving pieces undefended)
- Ignoring opponent threats (only thinking about your own moves)
- Premature queen development (moving the queen too early)
- Forgetting to castle (leaving the king in the center)
- Not controlling the center (playing on the edges)

## Phase 2: Tactical Basics (600-1000 Elo)

**Duration:** 30-50 hours of study and practice
**Target Audience:** Players who understand basics and want to improve tactical skills
**Learning Method:** Pattern recognition combined with calculation practice

### Prerequisites (from Phase 1)

- Solid understanding of all piece movements
- Ability to recognize check and checkmate
- Knowledge of piece values
- Familiarity with basic opening principles

### Learning Objectives

By the end of Phase 2, learners will:
- Recognize and execute all major tactical patterns
- Spot and avoid tactical traps
- Understand basic pawn structures
- Play logically ordered opening systems
- Execute fundamental endgames
- Calculate 2-3 moves ahead in tactical positions
- Understand positional principles basics

### Phase 2 Lessons

#### Lesson 2.1: Knight Forks
**Duration:** 2-3 hours

Knights are unique tactical pieces due to their jumping ability. Learn to use this to your advantage.

- Classic knight fork: attacking king and queen simultaneously
- Knight forks of multiple pieces: how the knight's movement allows it to attack pieces on different-colored squares
- Recognizing fork opportunities: knight outposts where it can't be attacked
- Defending against knight forks: keeping pieces well-separated
- Solving 25+ knight fork puzzles

**Key insight:** Knights are incredibly dangerous when placed in the center of the board where they control many squares.

#### Lesson 2.2: Queen and Rook Forks
**Duration:** 2 hours

Queens and rooks are long-range pieces. Learn to use them for tactical attacks.

- Queen forks: simultaneous attacks on widely separated pieces
- Rook forks: attacking along files and ranks
- Combined fork patterns: setting up multi-piece tactics
- Defense techniques: moving pieces off dangerous lines

#### Lesson 2.3: Pins (Absolute and Relative)
**Duration:** 2-3 hours

Pins restrict piece movement because moving them would expose a more valuable piece to capture.

- Absolute pins: the pinned piece cannot move without leaving the king in check
- Relative pins: the pinned piece can move but loses material
- Recognizing pin opportunities: finding alignment of valuable pieces
- Exploiting pins: attacking pinned pieces
- Breaking pins: moving the piece being protected or the king

**Key insight:** Pinned pieces are constrained pieces. Use pins to reduce your opponent's options.

#### Lesson 2.4: Skewers and Discovered Attacks
**Duration:** 2-3 hours

Advanced tactical patterns that involve moving one piece to create threats with another.

- Skewers: forcing a valuable piece to move and capturing a less valuable piece behind it
- Discovered attacks: moving one piece to reveal a strong attack from another piece behind it
- Discovered check: a special discovered attack where the revealed attack is a check
- Double attacks: combining multiple tactical themes in one move

#### Lesson 2.5: Pawn Structure Fundamentals
**Duration:** 2-3 hours

Pawns define the character of a position. Understanding pawn structures helps you make strategic plans.

- Isolated pawns: pawns without adjacent pawns for support (weak but sometimes strong)
- Doubled pawns: multiple pawns on the same file (weak and passive)
- Passed pawns: pawns with no opposing pawns in front of them (strong in endgames)
- Pawn islands: groups of connected pawns (fewer islands = better structure)
- Pawn breaks: pawn moves that change the structure and open up tactical possibilities

**Key insight:** Good pawn structure is the foundation of good positions.

#### Lesson 2.6: Opening Systems
**Duration:** 4-5 hours

Rather than memorizing specific moves, learn to play logical opening systems that follow principles.

- Italian Game: light-squared bishops on c4 opposing f7, active play in the center
- London System: solid positional system with consistent piece placement (Bf4, Nf3, c3, d3)
- Sicilian Defense basics: 1.e4 c5, asymmetrical positions with good winning chances for both sides
- French Defense: solid closed positions with maneuvering opportunities
- Ruy Lopez: most popular opening, positional maneuvering around the d5 square
- Caro-Kann Defense: solid closed opening, less sharp than Sicilian

See `references/opening-guide.md` for detailed explanations.

#### Lesson 2.7: Fundamental Endgames
**Duration:** 3-4 hours

Endgames with few pieces have concrete winning or drawing techniques.

- King and pawn vs king: opposition and the square rule
- Rook and pawn vs rook: active king placement, cutting off the king
- Queen vs rook: how the queen's power advantage converts to mate
- Two rooks vs king: checkmate techniques
- Practical endgame principles: activity over material, passed pawn power

### Phase 2 Success Criteria

- Solve 100+ tactical puzzles (2-3 move combinations) with 70%+ accuracy
- Play 10+ games with sound tactical awareness
- Correctly identify pawn structure strengths and weaknesses
- Demonstrate opening system knowledge through game play
- Successfully execute basic endgames when material is simplified

- Understand and apply positional principles effectively
- Recognize weak squares and outposts
- Plan strategically multiple moves ahead
- Execute complex tactical combinations
- Build and execute opening repertoires
- Play complex endgames with strategic understanding
- Analyze positions critically using multiple criteria

### Phase 3 Lessons

#### Lesson 3.1: Positional Principles and Weak Squares
**Duration:** 3-4 hours

Positional play is about subtle advantages that accumulate over time.

- Weak squares: squares that cannot be controlled by pawns and become strong outposts
- Outposts: perfect squares for piece placement where they're protected and hard to attack
- Creating weaknesses: inducing your opponent to create structural problems
- Exploiting weaknesses: placing pieces on outposts and creating threats
- Prophylactic thinking: preventing opponent's plans before executing your own

**Key insight:** A strategically placed piece on an outpost is worth more than material.

#### Lesson 3.2: Piece Activity and Centralization
**Duration:** 2-3 hours

Active pieces create threats and limit opponent options. Centralization matters more than material count.

- Comparing active vs passive pieces: activity compensates for material
- Piece placement evaluation: which squares are strong for which pieces
- Piece maneuvers: rerouting pieces to better squares through multiple moves
- Tempo and rhythm: timing piece improvements with threats
- Dynamic vs static advantages: temporary imbalances in activity

#### Lesson 3.3: Advanced Tactical Combinations
**Duration:** 4-5 hours

Complex combinations involving multiple tactical themes, sacrifices, and compensation.

- Sacrifices for positional advantage: giving up material for long-term compensation
- Removing defenders: clearing defenders out of key squares
- Interference: placing pieces to block communication between opponent's pieces
- Clearance sacrifices: moving pieces out of the way with tempo
- Analyzing combinations: calculating multiple candidate moves with deep precision

#### Lesson 3.4: Rook Endgames and Active Defense
**Duration:** 3-4 hours

Rook endgames are crucial in practical play. They require precise technique and active defense.

- Lucena position: building a bridge to stop checks
- Philidor position: passive defense that holds drawn positions
- Active rook play: attacking pawns and controlling key squares
- Fortress positions: defensive positions that cannot be broken
- Practical technique: when to push pawns, when to activate the king

#### Lesson 3.5: Opening Repertoire Building
**Duration:** 5-6 hours

Instead of just knowing opening systems, build a personal repertoire with understanding.

- Selecting openings that match your style: aggressive, positional, or solid
- Building depth: understanding the key positions and typical plans in your openings
- Studying master games: seeing how strong players handle your chosen openings
- Adapting to opponent's style: having flexibility in your opening choices
- Studying recent games: understanding modern trends and improvements

#### Lesson 3.6: Endgame Conversion with Multiple Pieces
**Duration:** 3-4 hours

Converting advantages into wins requires accurate technique in positions with multiple pieces.

- Queen endgames: perpetual check possibilities, fortress positions
- Rook and bishop vs rook: technique for winning positions
- Opposite-colored bishop endgames: often more drawable than same-colored bishops
- Pawn races: calculating whether a passed pawn queens before opponent checkmates
- Technical endgames: positions that require precise moves to win

#### Lesson 3.7: Strategic Planning and Position Evaluation
**Duration:** 4-5 hours

The highest level of chess thinking: evaluating positions and creating long-term plans.

- Assessing positions: material, pawn structure, piece activity, king safety, initiative
- Creating plans: identifying long-term goals and the concrete steps to achieve them
- Recognizing imbalances: advantages and disadvantages for both sides
- Adjusting plans: modifying strategy as the position evolves
- Finding candidate moves: generating the most promising moves based on position evaluation

### Phase 3 Success Criteria
